    </font></strong><small><br>
    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></u></font><br>
    You've decided to buy an investment property for $125,000 which you believe will increase
    in value in the next 10 years. You want to use your savings to remodel. You also want to
    be sure the cash flow on the property is positive (the rental income greater than the loan
    and property costs). You are considering making an offer using a balloon payment loan to
    the motivated seller who is willing to accept a &quot;No Money Down&quot; offer. Your
    offer options are all short term 10 year loans with different interest rates and different
    balloon payments. <br>
    <br>
    <strong><font color="#804000"><u>SOLUTION:</u></font></strong><br>
    You can see by using the <strong><font color="#000080">Quick</font><font color="#FF0000">C</font><font
    color="#000080">alc</font> <font color="#804000">Loan Calculator with Balloon Payment</font></strong>
    there are very different answers to all of the variables. Forecasting what you think the
    increase in value of the property will be in 10 years you can now make your offer and know
    you have the balloon payment covered if you choose to sell at that time.</small></font></td>

    Loan?</strong></u></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">This loan option is often used in purchases as
    an alternative to conventional lending. It is a regular loan with a balloon payment or
    future payment due at the end of the term of the loan. This type of loan is used most
    frequently for autos and real estate. It allows you to make your purchase while reducing
    your monthly payment and postponing a large amount of the principal to the end of the
    contract. The advantages are not only the lower monthly payment but a large reduction in
    interest expense. Even though the payments may not seem to be significantly lower, the
    amount of the principal going toward paying off the loan is proportionately much greater.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">The Balloon payment loan can be used for:<br>
    1. Auto purchases<br>
    2. First time home buyers<br>
    3. No money down real estate purchases<br>
    4. Commercial property<br>
    5. Personal loans</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#008000"><u><strong>Example of a balloon payment
    Loan for autos - this type of loan is offered by many credit unions and auto dealers -
    Minimized Auto Payment:</strong></u></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">This loan option is often used in auto purchases
    as an alternative to leasing. It is called MAP which stands for Minimized Auto Payment
    loan. It is a regular vehicle loan with a balloon payment due at the end of the term of
    the loan. It allows you to own a new vehicle with a used vehicle payment. All new and used
    vehicles up to 2 model years old are eligible for MAP. New vehicles can be financed for
    12-60 months. Used vehicles may be financed 12-48 months depending on their age. There are
    no penalties for pre-payment.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">The future value, or balloon amount, will be
    determined prior to loan closing and be guaranteed. </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">At the end of the MAP loan term, the choice is
    yours... <br>
    1. Return the vehicle to your credit union or dealer.<br>
    2. Sell or trade the vehicle and pay off the remaining loan balance.<br>
    3. Keep the car and refinance the remainder of the loan.</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#804000">Benefits of
    Loaning versus leasing: </font></strong><br>
    1. Owning a new, warranted vehicle for the lowest possible payment.<br>
    2. No security deposits.<br>
    3. No &quot;wear and tear&quot; penalties.<br>
    4. Easy-to-understand documents - no fine print or hidden clauses<br>
    5. No end-of-lease surprises.</font></small></td>
