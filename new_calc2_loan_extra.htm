    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></u></font><br>
    You are considering paying down a high interest personal loan in order to take advantage
    of the reduction of time and the interest return you will receive on the extra payment.
    Your loan is for $18,000, without a balloon payment due, and payable in 60 months. You
    know your present interest is 18%. What would be your loan balance and the interest %
    return on the extra payment in 12 months if you added $50 to the payment?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>SOLUTION: </strong></u></font><br>
    With the QuickCalc Loan Calculator With Extra Payment you can see that after the first
    year you would have a balance of $15,560 without the extra payment and $14,908 with. This
    is a difference of $652. The interest paid without the extra payment is $3,045 and $2,993
    with. This is a interest savings of $52 on $600 of extra payments. The return on your $600
    would be 8.34%. And this is a <font color="#FF0000">guaranteed return</font> because the
    interest is reduced immediately each month.<br>
    <br>
    You can also see by putting 51 months in the &quot;Payments Made&quot; cell that the loan
    will be paid off 9 months early. This way you will have paid a total of $25,893 in
    payments - $2,550 of which is the extra payment that has received a 7.67% return. And over
    the full term of the loan you will save $1,532 in total cash outlay for the extra payment
    of $2,550 in 51 months. <br>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Many times we have considered the best way to
    pay off our debts. Should we just borrow the money and pay off the debts with a lower
    interest rate loan? Should we refinance? Should we apply additional payments to the loan?
    Which of these is the most frugal use of our cash flow?</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>In today's financial market place loans often
    carry very high interest charges. This is normal especially when purchasing equipment or
    when good credit has not been established.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>By making extra payments you have 3 major
    benefits:<br>
    1. You reduce the outstanding balance of the loan.<br>
    2. Reduce the length of time left to pay.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><u><font color="#804000"><strong>But the most
    significant is:</strong></font></u><br>
    3. <font color="#FF0000">You receive immediate guaranteed return on your extra payment
    equal to approximately 1/2 of the interest rate you are paying on the loan. This is
    realized in the next month's reduction of the interest due.</font></small></font></td>
