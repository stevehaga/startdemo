<BR>
Your database is a "pipe" (which looks like this: | ) delimited flat database which means you can  import this file into any common database program for manipulation.  To save the file from most web browsers just click on "file" then choose "save-as".  The organization of the database is as follows:

<BR><BR>
"date" | "time" | "friend's e-mail address" | "user's e-mail address" | "user's name" | "yes or blank answer to request for future contact"
<BR><BR>

The script that runs the program writes one line to this database for the user and one line for each friend that he sends a web-postcard to.  On the lines that print information about the user, both e-mail fields have the user's e-mail address.  The time and date functions on the program are set to California USA time which, depending on the time of year is either Pacific Standard Time (PST) or Pacific Day-light Savings Time (which would be one hour ahead of PST).

<BR><BR>
If the database does not appear to reflect newer information be sure to follow your browsers instructions to clear it's cache and reload the newest verions of the database file.
