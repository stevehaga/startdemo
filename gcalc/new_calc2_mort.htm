    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></u></font><br>
    You have finally made the decision to buy your first home. You have saved up $35,000 and
    you want to put $25,000 as a down payment while keeping $10,000 for cash on hand to use to
    fix up the property and to keep in reserve. The property is selling for $125,000 and with
    the $25,000 you can qualify for a loan 80% LTV (loan to value ratio) without the need for
    MI. (private mortgage insurance) Now you want to determine the monthly payment for a 7.5%,
    7.0% and 6.5%.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></u></font><br>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Before the 1929 stock market crash, cash
    purchases of homes were the norm. Or if money was borrowed it was on a term that typically
    didn't last much more than five years. That made payments relatively steep, which is part
    of the reason so many homes were lost in the Great Depression. After World War II the U.S.
    government created a mortgage program that allowed veterans to make affordable payments
    over a 30-year period. From that need and support has sprung the modern mortgage and all
    of the different programs</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Yet actually mortgages are quite simple to
    understand as a financial tool for owning real estate. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial" color="#804000"><strong><small>Lots of choices</small></strong></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>Today, the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, while
    still the most common way to buy a home, is just one of many financing options available.
    Indeed, many mortgages today are almost custom-tailored to individual needs. Mortgage
    lending is a highly competitive field. Information on mortgage rates, which can change
    daily, is available in local newspapers, the Internet, through mortgage brokers and from
    individual lenders. When you're shopping for a loan, interest rates tell just part of the
    story. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>The fundamental financial property of a mortgage
    is the <font color="#804000"><strong>Interest rate</strong></font>. If we know the
    interest rate and have a loan calculator we can plug in the other known variables and
    determine the monthly payment. The <strong><font color="#000080">Quick</font><font

    Calculator</font></strong> gives you the opportunity to look at all of these variables and
    make your own decisions - before you talk to a professional . You can always go to the
    paper and find out the current rates. But what you need to do is consider all of the
    variables as they apply to you and your situation.</small></font></td>
