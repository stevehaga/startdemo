    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></u></font><br>
    Your company has decided to purchase a company car. Past history has shown that these cars
    usually last about 3 to 4 years and then you have to sell them. You are looking this time
    to possibly lease the car and lower the monthly payment. The car is selling for $35,000.
    You have also decided that you want to have a $15,000 residual value (future value or
    balloon payment) due at the end of the lease. In speaking with 3 different lease companies
    you have found it difficult to know exactly what are your payments and interest rates
    because each company has different terms.<br>

    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>In today's economic climate, companies and
    individuals are increasingly challenged to provide funding for essential equipment and
    services. Leasing can help you fulfill these obligations - and achieve your financial
    goals. Leasing can provide a flexible and convenient financing alternative with a
    customized repayment schedule that matches your cash flow. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>With a lease you have the option to acquire
    assets over a fixed term with fixed payments at a fixed, tax-exempt interest rate and have
    the right to purchase the equipment at the expiration of the term. The annually renewable
    nature of some leases can allow you to avoid having the financing classified as
    &quot;debt&quot; for purposes of state law debt limitations. And, by leasing, your yearly
    expenditures are lower, helping you strengthen your budget and cash flow position. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>At the end of the lease contract, the lease
    gives you the opportunity to buy the equipment on advantageous terms. Usually the lease
    company retains a security interest until the end of the agreement term. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>In the public sector lease financing allows you
    to take full advantage of your tax-exempt status, which lets you make acquisitions at
    current prices while enjoying immediate cost savings.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><big><strong><font face="Arial">- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - </font></strong></big></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><font color="#FF0000"><strong>NOTE:</strong></font>
    Many lease companies have hidden charges which will make payment and interest values very
    different - be sure to ask for a complete disclosure as to the hidden charges and the
    methods. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small>One of the key benefits of a lease is that you
    can write off all of the payment. With the loan you must depreciate the amortized cost. As
    in any major investment consult your financial professional to determine which option is
    the best for you.</small></font></td>
