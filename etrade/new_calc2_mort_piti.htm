    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></u></font><br>
    You want to find out the monthly financing cost on an investment property you are looking
    at buying, including the property taxes, home and mortgage insurance or P.I.T.I. The property is selling for $125,000 and you will be putting 20% down.  You know that
    the property taxes are $125, the home insurance is $25, and the mortgage insurance is $42.
    You have spoken with a lender and he has given you the current interest rates on a 30, 20
    and 15 year mortgage with interest rates of 7%, 6.5% and 6.25% respectively.<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></u></font><br>
    You estimate that the monthly gross monthly income from your potential renters will be
    $950. With the QuickCalc Mortgage Calculator with P.I.T.I. you can determine that the 30
    and the 20 year loans will provide you with a positive cash flow where the 15 year loan
    will not.<br>

    This stands for the <font color="#804000">principal, interest, taxes (real estate) and
    insurance (hazard)</font>, the 4 costs normally included in a monthly mortgage payment.
    The monthly payment for the principal and interest go to the lender to repay the debt
    while the real estate taxes and insurance go into the escrow or custodial account to pay
    these amounts when due. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><strong><font color="#008000">Property Taxes: </font></strong><br>
    These taxes are assessed by the county to provide a base of income for the community
    upkeep of the county services. The rate is usually about 1 1/4% of the value of the
    property payable in installments.</small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><strong><font color="#008000">Home Insurance: </font></strong><br>
    Homeowners with mortgages are required by their lenders to have <font color="#804000">home
    insurance</font> to protect the property from damage caused by fire, weather and other
    hazards Many people may think that the policy terms required by their lenders represent
    &quot;OK&quot; levels of insurance but this may not be true. Lenders want to make sure
    their exposure is covered but that can happen without you being fully protected. So it's
    important that you determine your needs as well and make sure they are reflected in your
    coverage. The proper home insurance coverage consists of getting the right type of policy,
    having the proper levels of protection within that policy -- including special provisions
    for jewelry and your computer stuff and the like -- and supplementing this coverage with
    special protection against natural disasters that ARE NOT COVERED in your basic policy. </small></font></p>
    <p align="left"><font face="Arial"><small><font color="#008000"><strong>Mortgage
    Insurance:</strong> (MI)</font><br>
    If your down payment is less than 20%, most lenders may require you to carry <font
    color="#804000">Mortgage Insurance</font> (or MI). Mortgage Insurance provides assurance
    that if you default on your payments, the lender will be able to recoup at least 80% of
    the money which was borrowed. The Buyer typically bears the cost of MI insurance for the
    lender. The buyer has some influence over the choice of insurer but ultimately the lender
    must be satisfied that they will be able to recoup any loses in case of default. Of
    course, the individual monthly payments change according to the amount of the unpaid
    balance remaining on the loan. </small></font></td>
