    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></u></font><br>
    You are a first time home buyer looking for the best loan which will fit your current
    needs. You are about to call several lenders. <br>
    <br>
    The property is selling for $125,000 and you are considering putting either 15%, 20%, or
    25% down. You know that the property taxes are $125, the home insurance is $25, and the
    mortgage insurance is $42 if you only put 15% down. But in speaking with your real estate
    agent she told you that your income and debt ratios will be the major fact you will be
    judged by and will determine the best loan you can qualify for.<br>
    <br>
    <strong><font color="#804000"><u>SOLUTION:</u></font></strong><br>
    With the <strong><font color="#000080">Quick</font><font color="#FF0000">C</font><font
    color="#000080">alc</font> <font color="#804000">Pre-Qualification Calculator</font></strong>
    you can know ahead of time what your income and debt ratios are. This information will
    help you make decisions as to what you want to do with your savings like putting more cash
    down or paying off some of your short term debts - Both of these will get you a better
    loan rate and a smaller monthly payment.</small></font></td>

    <p><font face="Arial"><small>One of the most frustrating situations to run into when house
    hunting is to find the perfect place, negotiate an offer everybody's happy with and then
    not be able to qualify for the needed financing. The best way to avoid this is to
    prequalify for a mortgage. You can do this through a lender before you even start looking
    at houses and you can use <strong><font color="#000080">Quick</font><font color="#FF0000">C</font><font
    color="#000080">alc</font> <font color="#804000">Pre-Qualification Calculator</font></strong>
    - so you're fully confident about what you can afford. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>There is no strict formula used by all lenders to determine a
    home loan amount, but a good working rule of thumb is that you can afford a home equal in
    price to three times your gross annual income. This formula, of course, needs to be
    adjusted to a number of factors:<br>
    1. Amount of available cash for a down payment.<br>
    2. Closing costs and cash reserves required by the lender<br>
    3. Your outstanding debts <br>
    4. Your total income<br>
    5. Your credit history<br>
    6. The type of mortgage you select<br>
    7. Current interest rates<br>
    8. Income and Debt ratios</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><font color="#008000"><strong><small>I</small>ncome and Debt Ratios</strong></font><small><br>
    What this means to you as a borrower is that your application for mortgage credit will be
    evaluated according to some rules of thumb that appear to be precise, such as the Income
    Ratio of your monthly payment to your income should not exceed 28 percent, or the Debt
    Ratio of your monthly payment plus monthly non-housing debt to your income should not
    exceed 36 percent. However, everyone knows that these rules of thumb are not completely
    accurate. </small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Because the rules of thumb are simplistic, lenders are not
    rigid in using them. On the one hand, you can &quot;pass the test&quot; of having enough
    income to satisfy the 28/36 percent ratios and still get turned down for a mortgage loan.
    On the other hand, you may &quot;fail&quot; to meet the test and still have your
    application accepted. These Risk Factors exceptions are discussed below. <br>
    </small><font color="#008000"><strong>1. Poor Credit History</strong></font><small><br>
    If you have a previous bankruptcy or mortgage default on your record, lenders will be
    reluctant to grant a new mortgage. However, an occasional late payment on a monthly credit
    card bill will not disqualify you for a mortgage. <br>
    </small><font color="#008000"><strong>2. Unstable Income Source.</strong></font><small><br>
    If your income is subject to fluctuations (for example, if you are paid on commission),
    the lender will qualify you on the basis of a conservative estimate of likely earnings.
    Self-employed borrowers receive particularly close scrutiny. <br>
    </small><font color="#008000"><strong>3. Inadequate Cash Reserves.</strong></font><small><br>
    If after the down payment you will have less cash in reserve than you would need to meet
    three mortgage payments, the lender may conclude that your loan could go bad if you were
    laid off briefly or had some other minor financial problem. <br>
    </small><font color="#008000"><strong>Qualifying In Spite of a High Ratio</strong></font><small><br>
    On the other hand, do not be discouraged if the prequalification calculator does not show
    that you can obtain as large a loan as you would like. Lenders will try as hard as they
    can to meet your needs. Among the options that they have are: <br>
    </small><font color="#008000"><strong>Accepting A Higher Ratio</strong></font><small><br>
    The lender can choose to allow you to pay more than 28 percent of your income to meet
    mortgage payments. However, usually the lender must find some other factor in your favor.
    For example, if the new payment will represent little or no increase from what you
    previously were paying in rent or a mortgage payment, this may help. Lenders also take
    into account compensating factors such as a large down payment or sizable cash reserves. <br>
    </small><font color="#008000"><strong>Alternative Loan Products</strong></font><small><br>
    If you do not qualify for a 30-year fixed rate loan, you may qualify for the same loan
    amount if a lower-rate mortgage can be found. However, few prudent lenders will use the
    initial rate on a short-term adjustable rate mortgage (ARM) as the qualifying rate. One
    rule of thumb is to use the maximum possible second-year rate. This often is below the
    30-year fixed rate.<br>
    </small><strong><font color="#008000">Prequalify yourself with</font> <font
    color="#000080">Quick</font><font color="#FF0000">C</font><font color="#000080">alc</font><font
    color="#804000"> Pre-Qualification Calculator</font></strong><small><br>
    If you're not ready to talk to an agent or lender, you can prequalify yourself with the <strong><font

    <font color="#804000">Pre-Qualification Calculator</font></strong> applying the same basic
    formulas used by the mortgage industry. This will give you a good idea of your price
    range. But when it's time for serious shopping, it's worth knowing exactly what a lender
    thinks. And it's worth confirming that your credit history doesn't hold any surprises. An
    experienced real estate agent can help you through this process.</small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial"><small>Once you know your ratios, you can continue to shop for the
    best mortgage deal while you're house hunting. Your real estate agent can provide you the
    names of reputable lenders and set up a prequalification meeting. Even after you're
    prequalified, it's worth moving forward with the loan application process as early in your
    house hunting as possible. The process can be lengthy, with lenders requesting highly
    detailed information about your debts, income, assets and credit history. By starting
    early, everything can be in place when you find the right home.</small></font></td>
