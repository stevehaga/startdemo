    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>PROBLEM:</strong></u></font><br>
    You are considering paying down your auto lease in order to take advantage of the
    reduction of time and the interest return you will receive on the extra payment. Your
    lease is for $35,000 with a residual value of $15,000 due and payable in 48 months. You
    have determined that your interest rate is 16%. What would be your lease balance and the
    interest % return if you added $100 for 12 months?<br>
    <br>
    <font color="#804000"><u><strong>SOLUTION:</strong></u></font><br>
    With the <strong><font color="#000080">Quick</font><font color="#FF0000">C</font><font
    color="#000080">alc</font> <font color="#804000">Lease Calculator With Extra Payment</font></strong>
    you can see that you would have a balance of $31,122 without the extra payment and $29,830
    with. This is a difference of $1,292. The interest paid without the extra payment is
    $5,324 and $5,232 with. This is a interest savings of $92 on $1,200 of extra payments. The
    return on your $1,200 would be 7.67%. And this is a <font color="#FF0000">guaranteed
    return</font> because the interest is reduced immediately each month.<br>
    <br>
    You can also see by putting 39 months in the &quot;Payments Made&quot; cell that the lease
    will be paid off 9 months early. This way you will have paid a total of $33,421 in
    payments - $3,800 of which is the extra payment that has received a 7.67% return. And over
    the full term of the lease you will save $3,486 in total cash outlay for the extra payment
    of $3,900 in 39 months.</small></font></td>

    <p align="center"><font face="Arial" color="#008000"><u><strong>Power of the Extra Payment</strong></u></font></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">Many times we have considered the best way to
    pay off our debts. Should we just borrow the money and pay off the debts with a lower
    interest rate loan? Should we refinance? Or in the case of a lease, should we apply
    additional payments to the lease? Which of these is the most frugal use of our cash flow?</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">In today's financial marketplace leases often
    carry very high interest charges. This is common especially with equipment or when
    companies have not established credit. </font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial">By making extra payments you have 3 major
    benefits:<br>
    1. You reduce the outstanding balance of the lease <br>
    2. Reduce the length of time left to pay</font></small></p>
    <p align="left"><small><font face="Arial"><strong><font color="#804000">But the most
    significant is:</font></strong><br>
    3. <font color="#FF0000">You receive immediate guaranteed return on your extra payment
    equal to approximately 1/2 of the interest rate you are paying on the lease. This is
    realized in the next months reduction of the interest due.</font></font></small></td>
